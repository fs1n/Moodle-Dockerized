## Issue Description

The test and update workflow is failing because of a PHP version mismatch. In the workflow configuration, PHP 8.3 is specified, but the container is trying to use PHP-FPM 8.2.

### Error Details

The workflow logs show the container is failing to start because it can't find the PHP-FPM 8.2 command:

```
2025-10-06 15:07:20,850 INFO spawnerr: can't find command 'php-fpm8.2'
2025-10-06 15:07:26,743 INFO gave up: php-fpm_00 entered FATAL state, too many start retries too quickly
```

This results in Nginx failing to connect to the PHP-FPM backend:

```
2025/10/06 15:07:23 [error] 12#12: *1 connect() failed (111: Connection refused) while connecting to upstream, client: 127.0.0.1, server: , request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "fastcgi://127.0.0.1:9000", host: "localhost"
```

### Expected Behavior

The workflow should be configuring the container to use PHP 8.3 when that version is specified in the workflow parameters.

### Possible Causes

1. The entrypoint script might be hardcoded to use PHP-FPM 8.2 instead of reading the configured PHP version
2. The supervisord configuration might be using a fixed PHP-FPM version (8.2) instead of dynamically setting it based on the input parameters
3. The PHP 8.3 installation might not include PHP-FPM or it might be using a different naming convention

### Suggested Solution

Update the container configuration to properly detect and use the specified PHP version, ensuring that when PHP 8.3 is specified, the container looks for `php-fpm8.3` instead of `php-fpm8.2`.
